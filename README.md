## Current Project ##

I am currently working on a compiler for my own custom programming language; SpaghettiScript.
It was named after the term 'Spaghetti Code' but that sounds more like an IDE like VSCode, so I decided with script.

Status:  Under Development

## Other Stuff ##

I work on roblox games as a scripter sometimes for fun, however I have never actually finished a project.

Another project I have worked on is Aucheri, with my classmates from college.
Aucheri is a bullet-hell game inspired by the likes of the touhou project. I was in charge of the artwork, but learned a small amount of GDScript during development.
